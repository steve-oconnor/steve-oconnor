ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm currently looking for a new senior, lead, or principal UX Design role.

In the meantime I'm constantly iterating my portfolio site, organising things with CamCreatives CIC, running around after my kids, and coming up with new agile team sticker designs for my sticker shop (coming soon).
